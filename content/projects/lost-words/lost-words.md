[_Lost Words: Beyond the Page_](https://lostwordsgame.com/) is a narrative platformer set in the pages of a young girl’s diary, featuring a story written by Rhianna Pratchett. I worked on many areas of the game, including general gameplay, player controls, scripting systems, localization, and more!
