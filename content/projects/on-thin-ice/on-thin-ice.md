_On Thin Ice_ is a short game about the climate crisis, what its impacts might look like, and what we can do to stop the worst of it right now. With the help of a time-travelling polar bear.

At least, that's the concept for the _full_ game. The version you can play here is a prototype made in a few for the [2018 Climate Jam](https://itch.io/jam/climate-jam-2018). It's more of a blueprint for a full game than it is a complete game in its own right.

It was the [best ranked](https://itch.io/jam/climate-jam-2018/results) entry - across Educational value, Scientific Accuracy and Gameplay/Fun - in the jam and received some very [positive comments](https://itch.io/jam/climate-jam-2018/rate/284315) from the judges!

> Love the presentation and polish. It's also nice to see the science embedded in the game mechanics rather than tacked on between levels.

> I LOVED this game! Such a simple but effective concept.  The mechanics of the game and the narrative sit so nicely together - it really was a joy to play and I agree....I see a full game in Nanuq's future!

I hope to revisit the project in the future and flesh it further by including, for example, mini-games that show what we as humans can and should be doing to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Until then, enjoy!

_On Thin Ice_ is available to play for free on Windows, Mac and Linux or in your browser via [itch.io!](https://karnbianco.itch.io/on-thin-ice)
