_Kinect Sports: Season Two (KS2)_ is a BAFTA award-winning Kinect game for the Xbox 360 co-developed by [Rare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd. "Rare") and [BigPark](http://www.bigpark.com/ "BigPark"), and published by Microsoft Studios. I worked on the game’s user interface and gameplay systems during my time as a Software Intern at Rare.

**Languages + Tools:** C++, ActionScript, Xbox 360 SDK/XDK, Scaleform, Visual Studio, Flash.

**Frontend + Challenges:** I worked extensively on _Kinect Sports: Season Two’s_ frontend menu systems as well as the interface for the Challenge system which allows players to compete online asynchronously.

**Social DLC:** As part of a [title update](http://www.rare.co.uk/news/title-update-for-season-two#mainContentBody "title update") for _KS2_ I was responsible for implementing new functionality that allowed players to upload their high scores to Facebook via a new Xbox 360 API. I also created UI that allowed players to share their scores via email.

**Basketball:** The [Basketball Challenge Pack](http://www.rare.co.uk/news/kinect-sports-season-two-basketball-challenge-pack "Basketball Challenge Pack") downloadable content (DLC) added a new sport to _KS2_ in the form of three new mini-games. I was responsible for the in-game UI (HUD, etc.) for all three, as well as some of the gameplay mechanics in _Shot Party_.
