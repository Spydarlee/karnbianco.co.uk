_Kinect Sports Rivals (KSR)_ is the latest instalment in the Kinect-powered sporting series, and the first entry for the Xbox One. As well as six sports, it features some truly amazing technology which can digitally scan you into the game in order to create your very own ‘Champion’ which you can take into the various sporting events to serve as your digital avatar.

My role on _KSR_ was UI engineer. That means my life was all screens, buttons, user experience, and so on. The game featured a non-trivial user interface, with a navigable 3D island serving as the main menu. I also, amongst other things, worked on the player management systems and helped integrate Xbox Live multiplayer matchmaking from a frontend perspective.
