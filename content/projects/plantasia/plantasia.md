_Plantasia_ is a small game about cultivating your very own plant-covered island paradise! Take a small, barren island floating in space and fill it with wondrous flora! Explore the universe to discover new species and help them grow. But most importantly of all, be sure to sit back, relax, and enjoy this  time with your new plant friends. <3
