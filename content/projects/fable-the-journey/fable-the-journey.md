_Fable: The Journey_ is an Xbox 360 game and also the fifth instalment in the _Fable_ series developed by [Lionhead Studios](http://lionhead.com/ "Lionhead Studios") and published by Microsoft Studios. It is the first entry in the series to require use of the Kinect sensor.

**Languages + Tools:** C++, ActionScript, UnrealScript, Xbox 360 SDK/XDK, Scaleform, Unreal Engine 3, Visual Studio, Flash, Unreal Editor.

**User Interface:** During my time on _Fable: The Journey_ I worked to ensure that the game’s Kinect-based user interface (menus, HUD, in-world indicators, etc.) was fully functional and robust. I achieved this with a mix of C++, UnrealScript, and ActionScript engineering solutions.
