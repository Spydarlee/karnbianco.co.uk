_[Eco](https://www.strangeloopgames.com/eco/)_Â is an online game where players must collaborate to build a civilization in a world where everything they do affects the environment. The game is developed by the Seattle-based Strange Loop Games who I worked with remotely from the UK. My primary responsibility was working on the localization system, as well as some gameplay quality of life improvements.
