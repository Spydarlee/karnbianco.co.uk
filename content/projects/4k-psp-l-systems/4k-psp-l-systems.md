My L-System demo was written in C for the PlayStation Portable, using an official PSP Devkit. It is designed to simulate moving through a virtual forest environment, with trees growing/shrinking as the user/camera moves through the world. The camera can be manipulated on the fly, allowing users to pause, look around, and admire their surroundings ‚Äì if they so wish!

### L-Systems

L-Systems (or Lindenmayer systems) were created by Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer to describe the development of simple multicellular organisms. They were later developed by Przemysaw Prusinkiewicz and others ‚Äì to describe more complex, branching structures. They are generated recursively, which leads to fractal-like self-similarity.

L-Systems are essentially a string of characters which can be represented graphically using a turtle interpretation of the string. Turtle graphics interprets each character/letter within the string as a command for an imaginary turtle with a position and orientation in the world. Commands include move forward and draw, turn left, and so on, which can be combined to create intricately complex systems.

### My Demo

My L-System demonstration features 6 unique L-Systems. Five of these are scholastic (semi-randomised), bracketed (branching) systems which represent ‚Äútrees‚Äù, while the sixth is a simple DOL-system (deterministic, non-random) which resembles a grid and serves as the floor and ceiling of the virtual world.

Each scholastic L-System is generated using a selection of randomly-chosen rewriting rules, allowing for variations of the same basic L-system. This reduces the artificial regularity which would otherwise be evident in a scene with multiple copies of the same L-System. Each of these ‚Äútrees‚Äù actually exists in a 2D plane is constantly rotated to face the camera at all times.

A new colour for the L-System is chosen from an indexed colour table at each branch of a ‚Äútree‚Äù, highlighting L-System‚Äôs ability to accurately represent organic structures. Trees are then rendered gradually ‚Äì with the number of branches increasing/decreasing every frame to simulate organic growth. Trees constantly move forwards to simulate ‚Äúwalking‚Äù through a forest.

The entire demo utilizes exactly¬†**4 KB**¬†of pre-linkage text (programming instructions) and¬†**1 KB**¬†of static data. Unfortunately I cannot upload the source code in its current form due its use of PSP library code. I am, however, currently working on a cross-platform version of the project which will also run on Windows PCs via DirectX.
