_Just Like Real Life_ is a unique and [critically acclaimed](http://www.develop-online.net/news/42193/JournoDevSwap-Just-Like-Real-Life-review) take on the [SHMUP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up) genre. It was developed over the course of 48 hours (5-7th October, 2012) for the JournoDevSwap game jam hosted by [Ukie](http://ukie.info/journodevswap), in which professional games journalists (with the help of student programmers) and games developers swapped places for the day.

The game’s key twist comes in the form of bouncing bullets. Every shot you fire will bounce off the scenery around you and subsequently pose a threat to your continued survival. The threat is often far greater than that posed by the enemies which also surround you wherever you go. You are, as ever, your own worst enemy. _Just Like [in] Real Life_

Developing _Just Like Real Life_ was made possible thanks the extremely intuitive [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game engine, as well as regular design input from journalist-turned-designer [Lewie Procter](https://twitter.com/LewieP). Additional selling points include an original, semi-procedural soundtrack by [Micheal Bowerman](https://twitter.com/Mikey_PB), and an online high score table (now defunct 😢) topped off with “infinite” gameplay.
