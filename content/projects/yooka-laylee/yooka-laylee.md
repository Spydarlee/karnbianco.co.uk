I joined the Playtonic team pretty early on and helped transform the original _Yooka-Laylee_ Kickstarter demo into a fully-fledged 3D platformer. I worked on: player physics and handling, cameras, enemy AI and the combat system, the minecart mini-game, performance optimisation, a visual scripting system, cross-platform development, and loads of other stuff.
