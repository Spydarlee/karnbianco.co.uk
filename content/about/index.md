Thanks for visiting my wee website! Since "we are what we repeatedly do" and all that, here's a bunch of stuff that I spend my time doing:

👩‍💻 I **design and build websites**. My main focus is full-stack web development, but I also have experience across dev ops and UI/UX/product design. [See my web projects.](/tags/websites/)

🎮 I **develop games**. I have nearly a decade of experience working as a software engineer in the games industry, including stints at both tiny indies and big AAA studios. [See the games I've worked on.](/tags/games/)

✏️ I **write**, to try and make sense of the world. Topics of interest include anti-capitalist and decolonial politics, philosophy, community technology, social and ecological justice, collective liberation, degrowth, anarchism, videogames, pop culture, and whatever my latest obsession of the month happens to be. [Explore my writing](/writing).

✊ I **organise** with others. In 2018 I helped found [IWGB Game Workers](https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/) – the UK's first trade union dedicated to empowering workers in the games industry. These days I'm most drawn to autonomous and anarchist organising projects.

👩‍💻 I **tinker with open source and community tech projects**. I release many of [my own projects](/projects) under open licenses, and I'm always keen to build and support distributive, community-based alternatives to big tech.

🚵‍♀️ I **frolic in nature**. I love hiking, cycling, cycle touring, camping, and wild swimming, but when health issues make these difficult, frolicking is the baseline.

📷 I **take photos**, *lots* of photos, mostly of the living world. That could mean snowy mountains, lush forests, or tiny flowers and insects. [Check out some of my photos](/photos).

💌 I **reply to emails**, most of the time. You can reach me at: karn[at]karnbianco.co.uk.
