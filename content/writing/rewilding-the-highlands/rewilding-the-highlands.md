A diary-style write-up of the week I spent volunteering with the charityÂ [Trees for Life](https://treesforlife.org.uk/rewilding-the-highlands-rewilding-the-soul/), planting treesÂ in Glen Affric in Scotland in 2016.

> One of my favourite moments took place while walking back after a big trek.
>
> Taking inspiration from naturalist Dan Puplett who weâ€™d spent a day with earlier in the week, we all sat down (spontaneously, without any words spoken) on the side of a hill looking down the glen, and simply took some time to be totally mindful of the rhythms of nature all around us.
>
> The tireless patience of the trees, the indomitable spirit of the mountains, the shifting patterns of the clouds, the perpetual whistling of the wind, and our own place within (and not separate from) it all.
